## Hi, I'm Ajit

I'm a self-taught fullstack web developer, previously an software development intern at [Keka HR](https://www.keka.com). I'm currently open for working on interesting projects where I can help you build a better experience for your customers. If you're interested in looking at my resume or just want to get in touch with me, then ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AjitZero) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/AjitZero)!

This blog is my little store of things I've picked up so far in my journey of learning software development and stuff that I tend to forget. I'll be updating this space soon with my work & portfolio, after migrating from Hugo to Eleventy.
